In Task1, Firstly understand the basic terminologies or core concept about UI/UX. Then create the mobile screen from popular app like Pinterest. Also create a wireframe for a home screen layout in Figma.

 A: BASIC UNDERSTANDING 
   
   DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UI/UX
   
1- UI (User Interface) "How it looks" 

UI is all about the visual design and interactivity of a product. It  focuses on the presentation and feel of the product’s interfaces.
The key components of UI are:

a-Colors

b-Typography

c-Buttons

d-Icons

e-Layouts

f-Spacing

g-Visual hierarchy

h-Responsiveness

The Goal of UI: Make it aesthetically pleasing and consistent with brand identity.

2- UX (User Experience) — "How it works and feels"

UX is about how the user interacts with the product. It includes understanding user needs, solving their problems, and ensuring smooth navigation from one step to another.
The key components of UX are:

a-User research (e.g., surveys, interviews)

b-User personas (who are the users?)

c-User flows (step-by-step paths users take)

d-Wireframes & prototypes (low/high fidelity)

e-Information architecture (content organization)

f-Usability (is it easy and intuitive?)

g-Accessibility (can all users, including disabled users, use it?)

h- A/B testing 

The Goal of UX: Make it usable, efficient, and satisfying for the user.


3- Design Thinking

Design thinking is an approach to problem-solving that focuses on innovative and creation. UI/UX usee the design thinking process to discover problems and comeup with creative solution by thoroughly understanding their user's goal.
Five phase of design thinking

a- Emphasize (understand the need of people)

b-Define (State the user needs and problems)

c-Ideate (comeup with innovative idea)

d-Prototype (Start creating solutions)

e- Test (try out solutions)
