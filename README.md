UI/UX INTERN Tasks
I have uploaded  completed internship task1, task2  assigned by YoungDev Intern:

Task1 File:

This file contains a detailed explanation of Task 1, where I first explored and documented the core concepts of UI/UX, including the difference between UI and UX, key components of each, and the Design Thinking process (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test).
I also included an explanation of the Double Diamond model (Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver). After understanding the theory, I applied my knowledge by recreating mobile screens inspired by the Pinterest app and designing a basic wireframe of a home screen in Figma.

Task2 File:

This file contain a detailed explanation of Task 2. It showcases the complete UX design for the Grab Grub food delivery app, including user research, personas (Student, Working Professional, Business Owner), journey mapping, and high-fidelity screens. It addresses major pain points found in competitor apps—such as app crashes, no live tracking, manual address entry, and poor payment experience—by offering real-time map tracking, saved addresses, rider info with chat, and a smoother, user-focused interface. The design improves usability and overall customer satisfaction through a clean, intuitive flow.
